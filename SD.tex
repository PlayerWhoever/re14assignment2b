The field I chose for this research is engineering, and my major is software development. I will introduce in detail the field, content, knowledge and capabilities, relation to the major and opportunities. By considering factors such as the content of the elective courses and the help for students' future careers, the elective courses I recommend for students in this field are ENGG1111 and DATA1002. The specific reasons are as follows.
\subsubsection{area these electives are from}
Engineering: The purpose of this area of Engineering is to process natural resources into something useful for mankind. This concept has appeared a few centuries ago, and 
the emergence of engineering talents has greatly increased productivity and efficiency.In the continuous development, engineering has derived many branches such as Chemical Engineering., Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, which greatly enriched the research content and research direction. According to Ralph J. Smith (1999), engineering requires a lot of professional knowledge and professional practice, through splitting the problem, concretizing the problem and deductive reasoning, and finally using these skills or knowledge to solve the problem.
\subsubsection{the electives are}
\paragraph{ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:} 
ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:ENGG1111 greatly integrates the teaching mode of professional knowledge and practice. Among them, the open design project emphasizes basic engineering and professional practical skills, and guides students to improve and integrate various abilities in the application. Through the learning of engineering knowledge, critical reflection and self-assessment, to enhance their lifelong learning ability. During this period, there were frequent communications, design projects and case studies. According to The University of Sydney(2021),students can experience the engineering design process, manage projects up close, and understand the importance of ethics, safety and sustainability.
\paragraph{DATA1002:Informatics:}
Data1002 focus on learning informatics.The University of EDINBURGH mentions: Informatics is the study of the structure, behaviour, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems(The University of EDINBURGH, nd).In more detail, it includes calculations and data processing, and the complexity of existing commonly used software Use (such as spreadsheets), use python language to develop custom software, etc. 
\subsubsection{knowledge and capabilities will be developed by undertaking these electives} 
\paragraph{ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:} 
Professional knowledge includes the understanding of basic engineering, the use of various equipment, and the use of various programming knowledge and various online tools. Through learning and practice, students can master the ability to communicate effectively with team members. Secondly, students have also strengthened their ability to acquire new knowledge, so that they can keep up with the speed of knowledge updating and not be eliminated even after entering the industry. In addition, the ability to solve problems and propose innovative solutions has also been improved.
\paragraph{DATA1002:Informatics:}
professional knowledge includes algorithms, social cognition, complex use methods of various data processing software, python programming knowledge, model construction methods and image construction methods, understanding of data system structure and behavior, etc. Professional capabilities include using python to develop simple custom programs and automate common processes of data processing, being able to use models to solve practical problems, and screening hardware and software to provide users with a better experience.
\subsubsection{how these electives might complement the knowledge and capabilities developed as part of the relevant major}
\paragraph{ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:} 
In Bachelor of Advanced Computing, Integrated Engineering and software development are inextricably linked. DRM Associates (2002) suggests that: Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components, including research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products. , The programming requirements required for engineering design are getting higher and higher, and the cumbersome procedures and details make excellent software indispensable. Not only that, but the bugs generated by the use of a large number of programs are also very tricky. It is easy to exercise at this time. It is the ability of students to use programming knowledge to solve vulnerabilities, thus making the road to software development smoother.
\paragraph{DATA1002:Informatics:}
The informatics learned in Data1002 can be applied to any computer-related place, let alone software development. Informatics can build innovative computing tools and applications and help us to interact intuitively with technology (Indiana University, n.d.). Data processing in the context of the new era requires high efficiency, brief introduction, and clarity. It tests whether students have good programming habits and excellent skills. Programming ability, people who are proficient in python can use simple programs to design powerful software to filter data. During this period, the ability to use programming to solve practical problems is exactly what software development needs.
\subsubsection{if the knowledge and capabilities developed by undertaking these electives will assist in your professional career}
\paragraph{ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:} 
First of all, we should fully understand the current situation of the industry. Engineers need to have a very wide range of knowledge reserves, including physics, chemistry and mathematics and their knowledge of material science, solids and fluid mechanics, etc., and this knowledge is continuously updated every day , Ralph J. Smith (1999) mentioned in the article: Many engineers continue to learn new materials throughout their careers. The learning skills cultivated in this course will enable students to quickly adapt to the working environment in the future, and rely on new knowledge to solve novel problems. The ability to communicate and solve practical problems formed during this period can better enable students to transition from school to the workplace.
\paragraph{DATA1002:Informatics:}
Informatics directly provides services for production and management. As many researches need to be supported by data, it has a very broad application prospect. In addition, by studying this elective course, students will develop their interest and ability in data modeling, and they will perform well in the fields of finance, medicine or artificial intelligence that require big data support in the future.
\subsubsection{if there are any opportunities resulting from undertaking these electives}
\paragraph{ENGG1111:Intergrated Engineering 1:}
Opportunity: (1) Administrative Assistant: Perform office work and paperwork, including entering data into the system, taking notes at meetings, managing the calendar, and helping the executive team handle daily work. (2) Warehouse Associate: build and package products, transport, receive, organize, clean and periodically count goods in a professional team.
\paragraph{DATA1002:Informatics:}
Opportunity: As mentioned above, Informatics is widely used and also provides many employment opportunities. KU MEDICAL CENTER (2020) points out: There are roles within informatics to suit several different personality types. Extroverts who like working with people make great trainers for health.
